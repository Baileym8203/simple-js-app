# What it does?
This app will tell you all the basic info about any Pokemon you want out of the 150 loaded pokemon from the pokemon V2 api. It will tell you the height, and types of pokemon as well as their names. And once you have clicked it will open an extra page to show the info described as well as the image of that evolution of pokemon like Charmander vs Charizard.

## My Role?
I was the full programer, and coderr behind this project. I did everything from the contrast picking to the behind the scenes code. ps It Was Fun!



## What I Used?
It was created using Bootstrap, jQuery ,javaScript, HTML,  and CSS. As well as AJAX and the external pokemon V2 api.

## My Thought Process
I thought while working on it what I could do to help people see what a pokemon looks like, and the basic info about the pokemon easily. Alot of it was down to basic additions like buttons, and a li list. Everytime I look at one of these projects though I think how can I make this website pop, and look appealing to the user. So I try to find the best fitting contrast ratios as well as best format. Since bootstrap is very accessible I used it to make the easy things glow, and pop like the navbars white vs black contrast ratio. So with this in mind after using jQuery as well as js to create the elements, and main process of the site I had to stick with this ratio in mind. So I cmade the buttons black, and white as well as the overall outline surrounding them.

## What I Learned?
When Creating something like this have the full thought of the user in mind. Whether it comes down to a cool looking spinning thing or loading times choose the ladder. The user is always way more important then the way a website can look. So always find a nice clean medium in your code!
